            <h2> About Us </h2>

            <p> USA Networks Mr.Robot is an American Drama-Thrikker series created by Sam Esmail The series follows Elliot Alndreson (Rami Malek), a young programmer and hacker who works at the cyber Securty company Allsafe as a security egineer.

            <p> Contorl can sometimes be an illustion. But sometimes you need illustion to gain control fantasy is an easy way to give realty with exapist comfort after all, isn't that why we surround ourselves with so many screns? So we can avoid seeing? So we can avoid each other ? So we can avoid the truth. </p>

            <p> Daemons, They don't stop working They're always active, They seduce, They manipulate. They own us, And even though you're with me, even though. I created you'll makes no difference. We all must deal with alone. The best we can hope for the onl  silver lining in all of this is that when we break through, we find a few familiar faces waiting on other side. </p>

            <p> The world is a dangerous place, Elliot, not Because of those who do evil, But becuase of those who look on and do nothing. </p>
